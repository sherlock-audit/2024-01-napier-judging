# Front-running swap TX and update the fee rate

## Summary

Admin could front-running a swap TX, update the fee rate, and charge additional fees that the users did not expect or were not aware of, leading to a loss of assets for the victims.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the contest's README page, it stated that the admin/owner is "RESTRICTED". Thus, any finding showing that the owner/admin can steal a user's funds, cause loss of funds or harm to the users, or cause the user's fund to be struck is valid in this audit contest.

> Q: Is the admin/owner of the protocol/contracts TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
>
> RESTRICTED

The admin/owner of the protocol has the ability to set the fee rate for the AMM's swap operation.

```solidity
File: NapierPool.sol
543:     /// @param value value of the parameter
544:     function setFeeParameter(bytes32 paramName, uint256 value) external {
545:         if (factory.owner() != msg.sender) revert Errors.PoolOnlyOwner();
546: 
547:         if (paramName == "lnFeeRateRoot") {
548:             if (value > MAX_LN_FEE_RATE_ROOT) revert Errors.LnFeeRateRootTooHigh();
549:             lnFeeRateRoot = uint80(value); // unsafe cast here is Okay because we checked the value is less than MAX_LN_FEE_RATE_ROOT
550:         } else if (paramName == "protocolFeePercent") {
551:             if (value > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_PERCENT) revert Errors.ProtocolFeePercentTooHigh();
552:             protocolFeePercent = uint8(value); // unsafe cast here is Okay
553:         } else {
554:             revert Errors.PoolInvalidParamName();
555:         }
556:     }
```

A malicious admin can perform the following steps to steal a user's funds:

1. The current fee rate for the swap is 1%.
2. A user submits a swap TX and expects to pay a 1% swap fee.
3. A malicious admin could front-run the swap TX, and execute to `setFeeParameter` to increase the fee rate to the maximum allowable value (e.g. 5%)
4. When the user's swap is executed, it will be charged a fee rate of 5% instead of 1%.
5. The admin/protocol wallet gains an extra 4%, which the user is not aware of.

## Impact

Loss of assets for the victim.

## Recommendation

Implement a timelock for making any change to the pool parameter.
