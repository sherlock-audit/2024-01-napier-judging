# Scale calculation rounds in favor of user during withdraw

## Summary

The withdrawal "divides by the ERC4626 `convertToAssets`" which results in a subtle round-in-favor-of-user.

## Vulnerability Detail

Multiplying shares `convertToAssets` in an ERC4626 vault converts from shares to assets. However, dividing by `convertToAssets` should not be used for converting the other way around (shares -> assets) because since the divisor rounds down this ends up as the conversion "rounding up".

`scale` is essentially the ERC4626 `convertToAssets` function with `1e18` as an input parameter. In this equation, the `maxscale` which was derived from `scale` is used as a divisor which has the "round up problem"

```solidity
uint256 sharesRedeemed = pyAmount.divWadDown(_gscales.maxscale);
```

Important note: this issue does not refer to the rounding of `divWadDown` which correctly rounds down. It refers to the rounding down of `maxscale/scale` which converts to a round up since sharesRedeemed is inversely proportional to scale.

`maxScale` was initially based off `convertToAssets` which we know rounds down. Since `sharesRedeemed` is inversely proportional to `maxScale` the rounding down of `maxScale` converts to a rounding up in sharesRedeemed. This can result in a multiple small withdrawals giving more shares back than the initial deposit even though no yield was accrued.

**Using share inflation to exacerbate the impact**

We can combine this rounding-in-favor with a share inflation during the initial deposit. An attacker can inflate the shares during the initial deposit to $10 USD per share through token donation. This amount is selected so the rounding error may be small enough to not be noticed by regular depositors but is large enough that the favorable rounding exceeds gas costs. Then, they could call withdraw with the round-in-favor repeatedly to drain the entire tranche.

## Impact

In normal use, this could result in the last withdrawer having their withdrawal revert due to slight insolvency of the protocol due to rounding in favor of the user. Since the user must attempt to withdraw their entire balance rather than entering an amount parameter in `collect()`, this can result in a significant amount of stuck funds.

By combining this vulnerability with inflated shares, the attacker could drain the protocol with many withdrawals with favorable rounding.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add +1 to the denominator. This basically converts the `maxscale` to a rounded up version.

```solidity
uint256 sharesRedeemed = pyAmount.divWadDown(_gscales.maxscale + 1);
```
