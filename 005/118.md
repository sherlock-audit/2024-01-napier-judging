## `NapierPool.sol:: swapPtForUnderlyin,swapUnderlyingForPt, swapUnderlyingForExactBaseLpToken`, and `swapExactBaseLpTokenForUnderlying` functions are suspectible to sandwich attacks due to lack of deadline protection"
label: "High Risk"

## Summary
The `NapierPool.sol` contract, which  is a pool that allows users to trade between a BasePool LP token and an underlying asset, is currently vulnerable to sandwich attacks due to the absence of a deadline parameter in its swap functions. This vulnerability arises because transactions can be delayed in the mempool, allowing attackers to front-run user transactions and exploit price changes to their advantage.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `NapierPool.sol` contract, there is no explicit deadline parameter protection implemented in the swap functions(`swapPtForUnderlyin,swapUnderlyingForPt, swapUnderlyingForExactBaseLpToken`, and `swapExactBaseLpTokenForUnderlying` ) to prevent transactions from being delayed indefinitely and to ensure that they are executed within a specified time frame , also price can be impacted and Front-Running is possible . 
The contract uses the `nonReentrant` modifier from the `ReentrancyGuard` contract to prevent reentrancy attacks, which is a good practice. However, there is no check for a deadline or expiration timestamp in the swap functions or any other functions that could be used to enforce a deadline.
The `notExpired`  modifier is used to ensure that the pool has not reached its maturity date:
```javascript
modifier notExpired() {
    if (maturity <= block.timestamp) revert Errors.PoolExpired();
    _;
}
```
However, this modifier only checks if the pool's maturity date has passed, and it does not enforce a deadline for individual transactions. 

### POC
Consider a scenario where a user wants to swap a token for another at a specific price. Without a deadline, the user's transaction could be delayed in the mempool, and by the time it is executed, the price may have changed significantly.
```solidity
function swapPtForUnderlying(
    uint256 index,
    uint256 ptIn,
    address recipient,
    bytes calldata data
)
    external
    override
    nonReentrant
    notExpired
    returns (uint256 underlyingOut)
{
    // ... existing code ...
}
```
Detailed Example - how a sandwich attack could be executed against the `swapPtForUnderlying` function:
1. The victim submits a transaction to swap a principal token (PT) for the underlying asset.
2. The attacker observes the victim's transaction in the memepool.
3. The attacker places a transaction to buy the principal token at a higher price before the victim's transaction is executed.
4. The victim's transaction is executed, buying the principal token at the higher price set by the attacker.
5. The attacker places another transaction to sell the principal token at a higher price after the victim's transaction is executed.
6. The attacker profits from the price difference between steps 3 and 5.


## Impact
The lack of deadline protection can lead to significant price impact for users, as their transactions may be executed at a time when the price has significantly changed, resulting in worse outcomes. 
Additionally, it can make the protocol more susceptible to market manipulation and front-running, which can negatively affect the integrity of the trading mechanism and the overall user experience.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- for example add a deadline parameter to the `swapPtForUnderlying` function and to mitigate the risk of sandwich attacks:
```solidity
function swapPtForUnderlying(
    uint256 index,
    uint256 ptIn,
    address recipient,
    bytes calldata data,
    uint256 deadline
)
    external
    override
    nonReentrant
    notExpired
    returns (uint256 underlyingOut)
{
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Deadline has passed");
    // ... existing code ...
}
```
Similarly reconsider other swap functions.

- Use Flashbots to reduce sandwiching probabilities.
