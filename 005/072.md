# wrong logic when calculating a fee

## Summary
in NapirPool  function like **swapUnderlyingForPt** and  **swapUnderlyingForExactBaseLpToken** doesn't transfer  the  swap fee and protocol fee from the swapper 
## Vulnerability Detail
both **swapUnderlyingForPt** and  **swapUnderlyingForExactBaseLpToken** are using the logic when swapping  pt to  underlying token which is subtracting the  fees from underlying amount  instead it should have added the fees  with underlyingIn  
Both function  uses PoolMath.swapUnderlyingForExactBaseLpToken(); to calculate the amount and when doing that  it uses -[**calculateSwap**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/libs/PoolMath.sol#L250) function 
`// Subtract swap fee
        // underlyingWithFee = underlyingNoFee - fee
        int256 netUnderlyingToAccount18 = netUnderlying18 - underlyingFee18;
        // Charge protocol fee on swap fee
        // This underlying will be removed from the pool reserve
        int256 underlyingToProtocol18 = (underlyingFee18 * pool.protocolFeePercent.toInt256()) / FULL_PERCENTAGE;
` and it will return these back to   the main function **swapUnderlyingForPt** and **swapUnderlyingForExactBaseLpToken**  and if we try to see the **swapUnderlyingForPt**  on line  [416 ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/NapierPool.sol#L416)it will try to save the returned values  like             **underlyingIn**, **swapFee** and  **protocolFee** and on line 
[437](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/NapierPool.sol#L437) it will try to call the router  but you can see that in the arguments that is  only using  **underlytingin** only and it is not adding the **swapFee** nor the **protocolFee** so it is only asking the router to only send  the **underlyingin** amount without the fees 
 but instead it should have added all the fees  in this case the user is not paying for a fees
## Impact
the proper amount of fee will not  be taken from the user in which the liquidity provider and the protocol will not get there share

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
when calling the router we should add the fees with the **underlyingin**
