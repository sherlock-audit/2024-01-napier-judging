# Share Inflation For Base LST Adapter

## Summary

The well known ERC4626 inflation attack works on the `BaseLSTAdapter` with minor adjustments.

## Vulnerability Detail

The BaseLSTAdapter is a normal ERC4626 vault. The only defense is this line:

```solidity
if (shares == 0) revert ZeroShares();
```

However, the inflation attack does not necessarily need to round down to 0. The attack can also be performed by rounding down from 2 to 1, as shown in this example:

Let the user's deposit liquidity amount be `L`.

- Attacker mints 1 share.
- Attacker mints `L/2 + 1` shares. 
- The user deposits `L` liquidity, giving them `L / (L/2 + 1) = floor(1.99...) = 1` share.
- Now if the user burns the 1 share, they would receive `1/2 * (L + L/2 + 1) = floor(3L/4 + 1/2) = 3L/4` liquidity, meaning they lost `L/4` liquidity.

The exact same attack at the Readme here. Scroll down to _"Frontrunning the first deposit may steal 1/4 of the deposit"_: https://github.com/ZeframLou/bunni/tree/main/src

## Impact

First depositor can break minting of shares and also steal 1/4 of an initial deposit through frontrunning.

## Recommendation

Note that an old version of OpenZeppelin's ERC4626 contracts was imported:

```soldity
import {ERC4626} from "@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.3/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol";
```

OpenZeppelin contracts 5.0 has built in mitigation to the inflation attack using virtual shares, so import the `5.0` contracts instead of version `4.9.3`
