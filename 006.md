# According to EIP-5095 Tranche.sol should have a view maturity function method but it doesn't

## Summary
Tranche.sol doesn't really conform to  EIP-5095  standard it doesn't have a view maturity function method

## Vulnerability Detail
Standards are strict and must be adhered to for the benefits of everyone.

Other protocols that  implement `ERC-5095` or ones that interact with `ERC-5095` could check and maybe use Tranche.sol's view maturity function method, but since it doesn't really have one they won't be able to.
```bash
 maturity
The unix timestamp (uint256) at or after which Principal Tokens can be redeemed for their underlying deposit.

MUST NOT revert.

- name: maturity
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []

  outputs:
    - name: timestamp
      type: uint256
```
