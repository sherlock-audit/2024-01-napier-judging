# User can drain pools that use tokens with multiple addresses

## Summary
There are ERC20 tokens that have multiple valid contract addresses such as the TUSD stablecoin. If a pool exists using this type of token as an underlying asset, a malicious user can create a new pool using an alternative address for that token and completely drain all of the underlying assets in the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `NapierPool.sol` contract contains a function `skim` that sends any excess underlying asset to the fee recipient (pool owner). The protocol mentions that it uses any ERC20 token, which means that the underlying token can be an ERC20 token that has multiple addresses. The `skim` function checks if there are excess underlying by calling `_balance`, which checks the balance of the token using the token address. It proceeds to correctly subtract the balance by the internal counting of the total underlying within the contract to calculate the excess, and send it to the fee recipient of the pool. 

A malicious user can create a new pool using an alternative address of the token, and immediately call `skim`. The internal counting  (`_totalUnderlying`) will be 0, but the balance of the token will be positive since that token exists in another pool. The contract, assuming that the tokens are in excess since the internal counting of that token is 0, will proceed to send all of the tokens to the user, completely draining the pool.

## Impact
All of the underlying asset stolen from pool that uses this type of ERC20 token.

## Code Snippet
[`NapierPool::skim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/NapierPool.sol#L519-L534)
```javascript
    function skim() external nonReentrant {
        (uint256 _totalUnderlying, uint256 _totalBaseLpt) = (totalUnderlying, totalBaseLpt);

        uint256 baseLptExcess = _balance(tricrypto) - _totalBaseLpt;
@>  uint256 feesAndExcess = _balance(underlying) - _totalUnderlying;

        if (baseLptExcess != 0) tricrypto.safeTransfer(feeRecipient, baseLptExcess);
@>  if (feesAndExcess != 0) underlying.safeTransfer(feeRecipient, feesAndExcess);
    }
```
[`NapierPool::_balance`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/NapierPool.sol#L606-L612)
```javascript
    function _balance(IERC20 token) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) =
            address(token).staticcall(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.balanceOf.selector, address(this)));
        require(success && data.length >= 32);
        return abi.decode(data, (uint256));
    }
}
```

## Recommendation
Consider warning users to not create pools using ERC20 tokens which can have multiple addresses
