# Incorrect rounding direction in Tranche::withdraw()

## Summary
When contract redeem user's underlying tokens by pt tokens, calculate the pt tokens which need to be burned down. Contract uses round down, users can use less pt tokens to get his underlying tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
When users want to redeem their underlying tokens by pt tokens, they can call redeem(). Redeem() will calculate pt tokens needed to be burned according to share amount. And contract uses round down here. It means users can use less pt tokens to redeem underlying tokens than expected. That will be dangerous in some special case.
```solidity
    function withdraw(
        uint256 underlyingAmount,
        address to,
        address from
    ) external override nonReentrant expired returns (uint256) {
        GlobalScales memory _gscales = gscales;
        uint256 cscale = _updateGlobalScalesCache(_gscales);

        // Compute the shares to be redeemed
        uint256 sharesRedeem = underlyingAmount.divWadDown(cscale);
        round down@==> uint256 principalAmount = _computePrincipalTokenRedeemed(_gscales, sharesRedeem);

        // Update the global scales
        gscales = _gscales;
        // Burn PT tokens from `from`
        @==>_burnFrom(from, principalAmount);
        // Withdraw underlying tokens from the adapter and transfer them to `to`
        _target.safeTransfer(address(adapter), sharesRedeem);
        (uint256 underlyingWithdrawn, ) = adapter.prefundedRedeem(to);

        emit Redeem(from, to, underlyingWithdrawn);
        return principalAmount;
    }
```

## Impact
Rounding direction is not favor of protocol.
