# Missing zero amount check may lead to loss of funds

## Summary
Malicious user can steal accrued interest from other user using `redeemWithYT()` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
This function is used for withdrawing underlying tokens from the caller in exchange for `amount` of PT and YT. Withdrawn amount will be the sum of the following:
    - amount derived from PT + YT burn
    - amount of unclaimed yield
    - amount of accrued yield from the last time when the YT balance was updated to now
If the caller is not `from`, `from` must have approved the caller to spend `pyAmount`. 
```solidity
function redeemWithYT(address from, address to, uint256 pyAmount) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        //...
        _burnFrom(from, pyAmount);
        _yt.burnFrom(from, msg.sender, pyAmount);
```
But any user with zero allowance also can call this function, if he pass `pyAmount` as 0, in other case function will revert due to `_spendAllowance()` in internal `_burnFrom` function:
```solidity
function _burnFrom(address owner, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (owner != msg.sender) {
            _spendAllowance(owner, msg.sender, amount);
        }
        _burn(owner, amount);
    }
```
In this case withdrawn amount will be the sum of unclaimed yield and accrued yield, and it will be tranfered to `to` adress, which is malicious user's adress:
```solidity
uint256 accruedInTarget = unclaimedYields[from];
//...
// Sum up the accrued yield, plus the unclaimed yield from the last time to now
accruedInTarget += _computeAccruedInterestInTarget(_gscales.maxscale, _lscale, _yt.balanceOf(from));
//...
uint256 sharesRedeemed = pyAmount.divWadDown(_gscales.maxscale);  /*---sharesRedeemed will be 0 ---*/
//...
// Withdraw underlying tokens from the adapter and transfer them to the user
_target.safeTransfer(address(adapter), sharesRedeemed + accruedInTarget);
(uint256 amountWithdrawn, ) = adapter.prefundedRedeem(to);
```
## Impact
Malicious user can steal accrued yield from any users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recomended to add zero amount check to prevent calling this function by users with zero allowance, when caller is not `from`:
```diff
+     if (pyAmount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
```
