# `stakeAmount` being 0 in BaseLSTAdapter.prefundedDeposits will cause reverts

## Summary
FRXETH_MINTER rejects 0 value submissions.
## Vulnerability Detail
[Here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbAFA44EFE7901E04E39Dad13167D089C559c1138#code#F1#L88) in the FRXETH_MINTER there's a check against 0 value submissions.

```solidity
 /// @notice Mint frxETH to the recipient using sender's funds. Internal portion
    function _submit(address recipient) internal nonReentrant {
        // Initial pause and value checks
        require(!submitPaused, "Submit is paused");
        require(msg.value != 0, "Cannot submit 0"); // @audit 
```
and it seems according to the comments by the devs in BaseLSTAdapter.prefundedDeposits() that `stakedAmount` can be zero in some scenarios like when availableETH is zero

```solidity
        stakeAmount = _stake(stakeAmount); // stake amount can be 0
```

now the issue is in the `_stake()` function that BaseLSTAdapter.prefundedDeposits() calls with the `stakedAmount` that can be zero in some scenarios. (like when availableETH is zero) 
```solidity
 function _stake(uint256 stakeAmount) internal override returns (uint256) {
        IWETH9(Constants.WETH).withdraw(stakeAmount);
        FRXETH_MINTER.submit{value: stakeAmount}();//@audit-issue  stakeAmount shouldn't be zero.
        uint256 received = STAKED_FRXETH.deposit(stakeAmount, address(this));
        if (received == 0) revert InvariantViolation();

        return stakeAmount;
    }
```

FRXETH_MINTER that rejects 0 value submissions is called with `stakedAmount` that could be zero, this will cause reverts.



## Impact
`stakeAmount` being 0 in BaseLSTAdapter.prefundedDeposits will cause reverts because FRXETH_MINTER rejects 0 value submissions. This will DOS tranche.issue()

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In BaseLSTAdapter.prefundedDeposits() check with an IF statement and ensure `stakeAmount` != 0 before calling the _stake() function.
