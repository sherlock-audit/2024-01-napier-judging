# Missing Zero Address Check for `Rebalancer` in `BaseLSTAdapter` Contract

## Summary
The `BaseLSTAdapter` contract presents a critical vulnerability as it lacks a zero address check for the rebalancer in its constructor. Failure to validate the rebalancer address against the zero address (`address(0)`) poses significant risks, including potential exploitation, loss of control over contract functionalities, and deployment failures.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the absence of a zero address check for the rebalancer in the constructor of the `BaseLSTAdapter` contract. Without proper validation, the contract allows the rebalancer address to be set to the zero address (`address(0)`), leading to adverse consequences and security vulnerabilities.

## Impact
As an impact of the vulnerability,  the contract may loose access to functions like reqestWithdrawal etc , which can be only called by rebalancer leading to funds being stuck in the contract forever.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address the vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a zero address check for the rebalancer in the constructor of the `BaseLSTAdapter` contract. The validation should ensure that the rebalancer address cannot be set to the zero address during contract initialization, mitigating the risk of deployment failures and security breaches.

```solidity
constructor(address _rebalancer) BaseAdapter(WETH, address(this)) ERC4626((IWETH9(WETH))) {
    if (_rebalancer == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress(); // Add zero address validation for rebalancer
    rebalancer = _rebalancer;
}
```

By implementing this validation check, the contract can prevent the rebalancer address from being set to the zero address (`address(0)`), ensuring the integrity and security of its functionalities.
