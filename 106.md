# Router can be DOSed by depositing 1 wei

## Summary

Router can be DOSed by depositing 1 wei, breaking the core protocol/contract functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

Many of the core functions depend on the `_pay` function. Note that at Line 100 below, if the token is WETH and the `msg.value` is non-zero, the TX will revert.

Thus, a malicious user can always deposit 1 wei of ETH to the Router to DOS the Router. As a result, users who want to interact with the Router via WETH tokens will not be able to do so. This attack is repeatable even after someone removed the 1 wei of ETH from the Router.

090:             // pull payment
091: 
092:             // note: Check value sent to this contract is zero if token is WETH9
093:             // Corner case: A situation where the `msg.value` sent is not enough to satisfy `address(this).balance >= value`.
094:             // In such conditions, if we wouldn't revert, `IERC20(WETH).safeTransferFrom(payer, recipient, value)` will be executed,
095:             // and the `msg.value` will remain in the Router, potentially allowing the attacker to claim it.
096:             // This is why we ensure that the `msg.value` is zero for pulling WETH.
097: 
098:             // note: NapierRouter inherits from PeripheryPayments and Multicallable.
099:             // Basically, using `msg.value` in a loop can be dangerous but in this case, `msg.value` is not used for accounting purposes.
100:             if (token == address(WETH9) && msg.value > 0) revert Errors.RouterInconsistentWETHPayment();
101:             IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(payer, recipient, value);
102:         }
103:     }
```

## Impact

Router, which is one of the core features of the protocol, will be DOSed. Breaking of core protocol/contract functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In a situation where the `msg.value` sent is not enough to satisfy `address(this).balance >= value`, convert the existing `msg.value` sent to WETH, and pull the shortfall WETH balance from the payer account.

```diff
function _pay(address token, address payer, address recipient, uint256 value) internal {
	if (token == address(WETH9) && address(this).balance >= value) {
		// pay with WETH9
		WETH9.deposit{value: value}(); // wrap only what is needed to pay
		WETH9.transfer(recipient, value);
	} else if (payer == address(this)) {
		IERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, value);
	} else {
		// pull payment
		..SNIP..
-		if (token == address(WETH9) && msg.value > 0) revert Errors.RouterInconsistentWETHPayment();
+		if (token == address(WETH9) && msg.value > 0) {
+			WETH9.deposit{value: msg.value}
+		}
-        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(payer, recipient, value);
+		IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(payer, recipient, value - msg.value);
	}
}
