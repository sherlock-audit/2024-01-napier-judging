# tranche is not eip-5095 complaint

## Summary
According to docs tranche should follow eip
> Is the code/contract expected to comply with any EIPs? Are there specific assumptions around adhering to those EIPs that Watsons should be aware of?
> EIP20 and IERC5095

Tranche is not eip-5095 complaint which may lead to other protocols not using napier
## Vulnerability Detail
According to [eip-5095](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095#withdraw)
> **withdraw**
Burns principalAmount from holder and sends exactly underlyingAmount of underlying tokens to receiver. -

but withdraw calculate sends underlying tokens based of input(computing share) and not input param
```solidity
    function withdraw(
        uint256 underlyingAmount,
        address to,
        address from
    ) external override nonReentrant expired returns (uint256) {
        GlobalScales memory _gscales = gscales;
        uint256 cscale = _updateGlobalScalesCache(_gscales);

        // Compute the shares to be redeemed
        uint256 sharesRedeem = underlyingAmount.divWadDown(cscale);
        uint256 principalAmount = _computePrincipalTokenRedeemed(_gscales, sharesRedeem);

        // Update the global scales
        gscales = _gscales;
        // Burn PT tokens from `from`
        _burnFrom(from, principalAmount);
        // Withdraw underlying tokens from the adapter and transfer them to `to`
        _target.safeTransfer(address(adapter), sharesRedeem);
        (uint256 underlyingWithdrawn, ) = adapter.prefundedRedeem(to);

        emit Redeem(from, to, underlyingWithdrawn);
        return principalAmount;
    }
