# Attacker can mint more shares when calling the `BaseLSTAdapter.prefundedDeposit()`

## Summary
From `Tranche.issue()`, `BaseLST.prefundedDeposit()` is called, which checks how many shares need to be minted by subtracting `bufferEth` from the contract balance. 

Any user can get ahead of another and spend more than they have sent funds
## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can get ahead of the user by calling `TrancheRouter.issue() > Tranche.issue() > BaseLSTAdapter.prefundedDeposit()` chain and use both his own and the user's assets for a mint

## Impact
An attacker can get ahead of the user to call prefundedDeposit and use his assets for a mint
