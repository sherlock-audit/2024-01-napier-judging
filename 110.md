# Attacker can approve any transfers from TrancheRouter to arbitrary addresses

## Summary

By crafting malicious `tranche` contract attacker can pass it to `TrancheRouter.issue` method, approving any transfer of any ERC20 from TrancheRouter to arbitrary addresses. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's examine the [`issue` method](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/TrancheRouter.sol#L38-L59). 
t
```solidity
 function issue(address adapter, uint256 maturity, uint256 underlyingAmount, address to)
        external
        payable
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        ITranche tranche =
            TrancheAddress.computeAddress(adapter, maturity, TRANCHE_CREATION_HASH, address(trancheFactory));
        IERC20 underlying = IERC20(tranche.underlying());
        ...
        underlying.forceApprove(address(tranche), underlyingAmount);
        ...
    }
```
We can craft contract on `tranche` address that will return malicious `underlying` parameter. We can also deploy crafted contract on specific address that is equal to `TrancheAddress.computeAddress(...)`  â€” we know in advance all the parameters passed to this function.

After that the TrancheRouter approves transfers of `underlying` to `tranche`, these parameters can be manipulated in crafted contract, thus allowing attacker to approve transfers of any ERC20 in `underlying` from `TrancheRouter` to arbitrary address in `tranche`. 

## Impact

Possible stealing of funds from TrancheRouter by attacker

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce more strict check for `tranche` address, store verified `underlying` and `adapter` in contract storage.
