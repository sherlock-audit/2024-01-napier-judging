# Improper Validation of Create2 Return Value

## Summary
No checking whether the code is deployed on that address or not.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `TranchFactory.sol` we have function `deployTranche()` to deploy the tranches using `create2` from `Create2TrancheLib` library. The function does not revert properly if there is a failed contract deployment or revert from the create2 opcode as it does not properly check the returned `address for bytecode`. The create2 opcode returns the expected address which will never be the zero address and equal to the computed address(as is what is currently checked [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/napier-v1/src/TrancheFactory.sol#L87)).

```javascript
function deployTranche(
        address adapter,
        uint256 maturity,
        uint256 tilt,
        uint256 issuanceFee
    ) external returns (address) {
        if (msg.sender != management) revert OnlyManagement();
        if (adapter == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        if (tranches[adapter][maturity] != address(0)) revert TrancheAlreadyExists();
        if (maturity <= block.timestamp) revert MaturityInvalid();
        if (tilt >= MAX_BPS) revert TiltTooHigh(); // tilt: [0, 100%) exclusive
        if (issuanceFee > MAX_ISSUANCE_FEE_BPS) revert IssueanceFeeTooHigh(); // issuanceFee: [0, 5%] inclusive

        // NOTE: computed Tranche address is used before deployed. it is ok if the YT doesn't call the tranche's methods in its constructor
        address computedAddr = trancheFor(adapter, maturity);
        YieldToken yt = new YieldToken(
            computedAddr,
            IBaseAdapter(adapter).underlying(),
            IBaseAdapter(adapter).target(),
            maturity
        );

        // store temporary variables
        _tempArgs.adapter = adapter;
        _tempArgs.maturity = maturity.toUint32();
        _tempArgs.tilt = tilt.toUint16();
        _tempArgs.issuanceFee = issuanceFee.toUint16();
        _tempArgs.yt = address(yt);

        // deploy PT with CREATE2 using adapter and maturity as salt
        // receive callback to initialize the tranche
@>      Tranche tranche = Create2TrancheLib.deploy(adapter, maturity);
@>      if (computedAddr != address(tranche)) revert TrancheAddressMismatch();

        // set back to zero-value for refund
        delete _tempArgs;

        // store the series
        tranches[adapter][maturity] = address(tranche);
        emit TrancheDeployed(maturity, address(tranche), address(yt));

        return address(tranche);
    }
```

But we are not checking whether the code is correctly deployed on that address or not.

Previously raised similar issue on sherlock [link](https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-13-improper-validation-of-create2-return-value-code4rena-mochi-mochi-contest-git).  

## Impact
1. DOS as the contract is not deployed and hence User will not be able to interact with it. 
2. Noone can create a new tranch with the same `adapter` and `maturity` value as code is not reverting and are storing the value [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/napier-v1/src/TrancheFactory.sol#L93) and checking it [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/napier-v1/src/TrancheFactory.sol#L63).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommended mitigation is to check whether the code is deployed correctly to not by adding 
`require(extcodesize(address(tranche)) != 0 )`.
