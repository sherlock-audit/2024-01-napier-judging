# Anyone can steal excess ETH from users

## Summary

The `PeripheryPayments` contract ideally shouldn't hold funds, however, because excess tokens are not refunded to users upon swaps, anyone can frontrun the calls to the refund functions to steal the user's excess tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `PeripheryPayments` contract has its functions public without access control for the most part, so anyone can call the functions.

Using the `swapUnderlyingForPt` function as an example, users can call the function to swap tokens or`ETH` for principal tokens. Situations can arise in which the amount sent in for the swap will have leftover e.g partial swaps, extremely efficient swaps, causing some tokens unspent (even when it was pre-computed precisely by the caller) and so on. 

For this case, the tokens are not automatically refunded back to the user. He has to manually call the `refundETH` function to get the remaining ether.

Since the `refundETH` function is accesible to anyone, the user's call to the function can be frontrun by malicious attacker monitoring the mempool and can be used to steal the user's refunds.
## Impact
Loss of user's excess ether.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
Reconsider the decision to allow users to manually call `refundETH` and execute refunds automatically after swaps.
