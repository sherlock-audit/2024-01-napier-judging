# In `TrancheRouter.sol#issue` function, don't set amount of tokens as allowance of this contract over the caller's token.

## Summary
Since amount of tokens as allowance of this contract over the caller's token has not been set, the user will forever be unable to issue PT and YT.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `TrancheRouter.sol#issue` function, The caller calls `underlying.safeTransferFrom()` to transfer underlying assets to TranchRoughter.
```solidity
function issue(address adapter, uint256 maturity, uint256 underlyingAmount, address to)
        external
        payable
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        ITranche tranche =
            TrancheAddress.computeAddress(adapter, maturity, TRANCHE_CREATION_HASH, address(trancheFactory));
        IERC20 underlying = IERC20(tranche.underlying());

        // Transfer underlying tokens to this contract
        // If this contract holds enough ETH, wrap it. Otherwise, transfer from the caller.
        if (address(underlying) == address(WETH9) && address(this).balance >= underlyingAmount) {
            WETH9.deposit{value: underlyingAmount}();
        } else {
53          underlying.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), underlyingAmount);
        }
        // Force approve
        underlying.forceApprove(address(tranche), underlyingAmount);

        return tranche.issue(to, underlyingAmount);
    }
```

However, amount of tokens as allowance of this contract over the caller's token has not been set.
Therefore, `underlying.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), underlyingAmount)` is reverted in #L53.
As a result, the caller will forever be unable to issue PT and YT.
## Impact
The caller will forever be unable to issue PT and YT.

## Recommendation
Add the following line to the `TrancheRouter.sol#issue` function.

```solidity
function issue(address adapter, uint256 maturity, uint256 underlyingAmount, address to)
        external
        payable
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        ITranche tranche =
            TrancheAddress.computeAddress(adapter, maturity, TRANCHE_CREATION_HASH, address(trancheFactory));
        IERC20 underlying = IERC20(tranche.underlying());

        // Transfer underlying tokens to this contract
        // If this contract holds enough ETH, wrap it. Otherwise, transfer from the caller.
        if (address(underlying) == address(WETH9) && address(this).balance >= underlyingAmount) {
            WETH9.deposit{value: underlyingAmount}();
        } else {

++          underlying.approve(msg.sender,address(this), underlyingAmount);

53          underlying.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), underlyingAmount);
        }
        // Force approve
        underlying.forceApprove(address(tranche), underlyingAmount);

        return tranche.issue(to, underlyingAmount);
    }
```
