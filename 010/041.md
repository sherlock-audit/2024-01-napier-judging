# Missing zero address validation for `Management` in the `constructor` of `TrancheFactory` contract

## Summary
The `TrancheFactory` contract lacks a check for the zero address `(address(0))` during initialization of the `management` address in the `constructor`, which poses a critical vulnerability.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises due to the absence of validation for the `zero address` (address(0)) during the initialization of the ` management` address in the `constructor`. As a result, if an invalid or zero address is provided during contract deployment, it could lead to unexpected behavior, exploitation, or loss of control over critical contract functionalities.
## Impact
Contract Deployment Failure: Failure to validate the management address against the zero address during contract deployment may result in deployment failures or unintended contract states.
Security Breach: In the absence of proper validation, malicious actors could exploit the vulnerability to manipulate or compromise the management address, leading to unauthorized access, unauthorized deployment of Tranche instances, and potential loss of funds.
Contract Integrity Compromise: The vulnerability undermines the integrity and reliability of the contract, posing significant risks to the security and functionality of the TrancheFactory contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
y incorporating this validation check, the contract can prevent the initialization of the management address with the zero address (address(0)), mitigating the risk of deployment failures and potential security breaches. Additionally, adhere to security best practices and coding standards to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security posture of the TrancheFactory contract.
```solidity
constructor(address _management) {
    if (_management == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress(); // Add zero address validation
    management = _management;
}
