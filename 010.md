# deploy() does not revert if contract deployment failed

## Summary

Improper Validation of `Create2` return value results in no deployment for that `basepool` ever again.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `PoolFactory.sol` , the `deploy()` function, which is used to deploy contracts with the `CREATE2` opcode, is as shown

[PoolFactory.sol#L-50-L92](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/PoolFactory.sol#L50-L92)

``` javascript
function deploy(address basePool, address underlying, PoolConfig calldata poolConfig)
        external
        override
        onlyOwner
        returns (address)
    {
        if (poolConfig.lnFeeRateRoot > MAX_LN_FEE_RATE_ROOT) revert Errors.LnFeeRateRootTooHigh();
        if (poolConfig.protocolFeePercent > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_PERCENT) revert Errors.ProtocolFeePercentTooHigh();
        if (poolConfig.initialAnchor < MIN_INITIAL_ANCHOR) revert Errors.InitialAnchorTooLow();

        address computedAddr = poolFor(basePool, underlying);
        if (_pools[computedAddr].underlying != address(0)) revert Errors.FactoryPoolAlreadyExists();

        address[3] memory pts = curveTricryptoFactory.get_coins(basePool);

        // Checklist:
        // 1. Base pool must be deployed by `CurveTricryptoFactory`.
        // 2. Underlying asset must be the same as the underlying asset of the principal tokens.
        // 3. Maturity of the principal tokens must be the same.
        uint256 maturity = ITranche(pts[0]).maturity();
        if (maturity != ITranche(pts[1]).maturity() || maturity != ITranche(pts[2]).maturity()) {
            revert Errors.FactoryMaturityMismatch();
        }
        if (
            ITranche(pts[0]).underlying() != underlying || ITranche(pts[1]).underlying() != underlying
                || ITranche(pts[2]).underlying() != underlying
        ) revert Errors.FactoryUnderlyingMismatch();

        // Set temporary variable
        _tempArgs = InitArgs({
            assets: PoolAssets({basePool: basePool, underlying: underlying, principalTokens: pts}),
            configs: poolConfig
        });
        // Deploy pool and temporary variable is read by callback from the pool
        address pool = address(Create2PoolLib.deploy(basePool, underlying));
        _pools[pool] = _tempArgs.assets;

        // Reset temporary variable to 0-value
        delete _tempArgs;

        emit Deployed(basePool, underlying, pool);
        return pool;
    }
```   
The `create2` opcode returns `address(0)` if contract deployment reverted. However, as seen from above, `deploy()` does not check if the deployment address is `address(0)`.

This is an issue as `deploy` will not revert when the deployment of `pool` contract fails then we cannot deploy the pool for that `basepool` ever again because we are checking at [line 61](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/PoolFactory.sol#L61) that the underlying should be `address(0) before the deployment` but because of no revert we are setting this non zero value [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/PoolFactory.sol#L80).

## Impact
Since `deploy()` does not revert when the creation of the `Pool` contract fails, users cannot be able to interact with that `basepool` ever.

Additionally, `deploy()` will not be callable for the same `basepool` , `asset`, thus protocol can never deploy a pool with these parameters.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. In `deploy()`, consider checking if the deployment address is `address(0)`, and if yes revert

```diff
   function deploy(address basePool, address underlying, PoolConfig calldata poolConfig)
        external
        override
        onlyOwner
        returns (address)
    {
        if (poolConfig.lnFeeRateRoot > MAX_LN_FEE_RATE_ROOT) revert Errors.LnFeeRateRootTooHigh();
        if (poolConfig.protocolFeePercent > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_PERCENT) revert Errors.ProtocolFeePercentTooHigh();
        if (poolConfig.initialAnchor < MIN_INITIAL_ANCHOR) revert Errors.InitialAnchorTooLow();

        address computedAddr = poolFor(basePool, underlying);
        if (_pools[computedAddr].underlying != address(0)) revert Errors.FactoryPoolAlreadyExists();

        address[3] memory pts = curveTricryptoFactory.get_coins(basePool);

        // Checklist:
        // 1. Base pool must be deployed by `CurveTricryptoFactory`.
        // 2. Underlying asset must be the same as the underlying asset of the principal tokens.
        // 3. Maturity of the principal tokens must be the same.
        uint256 maturity = ITranche(pts[0]).maturity();
        if (maturity != ITranche(pts[1]).maturity() || maturity != ITranche(pts[2]).maturity()) {
            revert Errors.FactoryMaturityMismatch();
        }
        if (
            ITranche(pts[0]).underlying() != underlying || ITranche(pts[1]).underlying() != underlying
                || ITranche(pts[2]).underlying() != underlying
        ) revert Errors.FactoryUnderlyingMismatch();

        // Set temporary variable
        _tempArgs = InitArgs({
            assets: PoolAssets({basePool: basePool, underlying: underlying, principalTokens: pts}),
            configs: poolConfig
        });
        // Deploy pool and temporary variable is read by callback from the pool
        address pool = address(Create2PoolLib.deploy(basePool, underlying));
+        if (pool == address(0)) {
+              revert PoolFactory__deployUnsuccessful();
+         }     
        _pools[pool] = _tempArgs.assets;

        // Reset temporary variable to 0-value
        delete _tempArgs;

        emit Deployed(basePool, underlying, pool);
        return pool;
    }

2. We can add a check whether the `Deployed Address` is same as `Computed Address` which we have implemented here
