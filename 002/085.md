# `swapUnderlyingForYt` function did not sweep unused ETH back to users

## Summary

`swapUnderlyingForYt` does not sweep the remaining unused ETH back to users, resulting in a loss of assets for the victim.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Napier Router is designed to support both WETH and native ETH for its operation.

The `swapUnderlyingForYt` function allows the users to pay in Native ETH with the support of the payable modifier.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/NapierRouter.sol#L297

```solidity
File: NapierRouter.sol
297:     function swapUnderlyingForYt(
298:         address pool,
299:         uint256 index,
300:         uint256 ytOutDesired,
301:         uint256 underlyingInMax,
302:         address recipient,
303:         uint256 deadline
304:     ) external payable override nonReentrant checkDeadline(deadline) returns (uint256) {
```

During the swap, it will make a callback to the Router, and the Router will need to ensure that `uPull` amount of ETH has been collected.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/NapierRouter.sol#L157

```solidity
File: NapierRouter.sol
85:     function swapCallback(int256 underlyingDelta, int256 ptDelta, bytes calldata data) external override {
..SNIP..
152:             // Pull underlying from payer.
153:             // Economically, it's almost unlikely that the payer doesn't need to pay underlying asset.
154:             // But if the above case happens, it would be reverted.
155:             if (params.underlyingDeposit <= uReceived) revert Errors.RouterNonSituationSwapUnderlyingForYt();
156:             uint256 uPull = params.underlyingDeposit - uReceived;
157:             if (uPull > params.maxUnderlyingPull) revert Errors.RouterExceededLimitUnderlyingIn();
158:             _pay(underlying, params.payer, address(this), uPull);
```

Before execution, the user does not know the exact amount of Native ETH to be sent to the contract as the actual on-chain condition might be different from the result during off-chain simulation. Thus, users will often send more ETH as a buffer to avoid unnecessary revert.

Bob transferred 100 ETH to the contract. However, in the end, only needs 99 ETH and the `uPull` is set to 99 ETH. Thus, the remaining 1 ETH is stuck in the contract at the end of the TX and will be stolen by MEV or front-runner after the TX.

```solidity
File: PeripheryPayments.sol
82:     function _pay(address token, address payer, address recipient, uint256 value) internal {
83:         if (token == address(WETH9) && address(this).balance >= value) {
84:             // pay with WETH9
85:             WETH9.deposit{value: value}(); // wrap only what is needed to pay
86:             WETH9.transfer(recipient, value);
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The remaining unused ETH should be returned to the caller after the TX.
