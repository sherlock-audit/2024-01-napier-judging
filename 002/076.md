# Fund loss when calling `swapUnderlyingForPt` as excess ETH isn't refunded automatically

## Summary

When a user calls `swapUnderlyingForPt`  they can deposit ETH in return for a desired amount of principle token (PT). In some cases, the maximum amount of the underlying asset (underlyingInMax), is never fully used in the swap execution. This results in access ETH being left in the Napier Router Contract. Any user can attempt to call refundEth() but a MEV bot can frontrun this unrestricted function, successfully stealing any user's refund.

User's calls `swapUnderlyingForPt` and swap results in excess Eth being left in the Napier router contract

User calls refundEth() in an attempt to claim their excess Eth.

MEV bot frontruns the user's refundEth() call and successfully steals the user's Eth.

## Impact

Users will not be able to successfully claim their refunds, incurring a partial fund loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The recommendation is to automatically invoke `refundEth()` when user's call `swapUnderlyingForPt` and there is excess ETH left in the Napier router contract
