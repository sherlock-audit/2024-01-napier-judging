# Vault inflation attack in StEtherAdapter::prefundedDeposit()

## Summary
Attack can donate stETH to StEtherAdapter in order to increase the share price.

## Vulnerability Detail
StEtherAdapter is one vault contract, take WETH as underlying, mint the related shares. In StEtherAdapter, we will use the ratio of share and assets to determine the share's price.  Assets is calculated via below function.
```solidity
    function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 stEthBalance = STETH.balanceOf(address(this));
        return withdrawalQueueEth + bufferEth + stEthBalance;
    }
```
Attacker can donate stETH into this contract to increase share's price.

One standard attack vector is as below:
- StEtherAdapter vault is empty.
- Alice as the first depositor, deposit one underlying token to mine one share.
- Alice donate 100 stETH tokens into vault, now share's price is 101 underlying assets.
- Bob deposits 200 underlying tokens, he will get only one share.
- Alice can call prefundedRedeem to redeem 150 underlying tokens to earn profits. 

## Impact
First depositor can manipulate share price to earn profits.

## Recommendation
Consider mint some shares to dead address to avoid vault inflation attack.
