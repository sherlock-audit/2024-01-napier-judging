## Summary
Not all ERC20 tokens are compliant to the EIP20 standard. Some do not return boolean flag, some do not revert on failure. 
Use `safeTransferFrom` consistently instead of `transferFrom` 

## Vulnerability Detail
Some [weird-erc20] tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false (e.g. [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code)).

https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20/#no-revert-on-failure
`YieldToken::transferfrom` is directly used to send tokens.
If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems.


## Impact
Passing an arbitrary `from` address to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`) can lead to loss of funds, because anyone can transfer tokens from the `from` address if an approval is made.
