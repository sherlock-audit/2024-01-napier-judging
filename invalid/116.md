# Lack of proper access control means anyone can withdraw funds sent to the NapierRouter

## Summary

`NapierRouter.sol` inherits from the `PeripheryPayments.sol`, this contract have the following functions, `unwrapWETH9`, `sweepToken`, `sweepTokens`, and `refundETH`. These functions allow any user to transfer any tokens sent to the router. Which could lead to lost of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Alice sends funds to the router before she could withdraw the token and attacker calls the
sweepToken function and claim her tokens

## Impact

Loss of funds

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function sweepToken(address token, uint256 amountMinimum, address recipient) public payable {
        uint256 balanceToken = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (balanceToken < amountMinimum) revert Errors.RouterInsufficientTokenBalance();

        if (balanceToken > 0) {
            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, balanceToken);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation 

Added access modifier to the following function so only authorized people can call them
 `unwrapWETH9`, `sweepToken`, `sweepTokens`, and `refundETH`.
