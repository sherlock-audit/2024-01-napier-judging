# `scale` should be the conversation rate from target to underlying

## Summary

scale should be the conversation rate from target to underlying, not the share-asset ratio in `ERC4626`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `BaseLSTAdapter.sol`, `scale` is calculated with `convertToAssets` in OZ's ERC4626 implementation:

    function scale() external view override returns (uint256) {
        return convertToAssets(1e18);
    }

However, such value cannot always be a substitute for real conversation rate from target token to underlying token. As Frax takes a fee at the time of withdrawal requests, which temporarily reduces the share price, and Tranche only track the MAX scale, so that create a arbitage opportunity for malicious users. They can simply deposit into tranche at a lower scale.

## Impact

arbitage opportunity on Frax adapter.

## Recommendation

Such value should be taken from corresponding protocol.
