# H-0 Potential Front-Running Vulnerability in addLiquidity Function

## Summary
The [`addLiquidity`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/NapierPool.sol#L158-L190) function in the NapierPool contract is susceptible to a **front-running** attack due to its reliance on an external callback mechanism for token transfers. The function does not enforce that the caller `msg.sender` who requests to add liquidity is the same entity that has transferred the underlying asset and BasePool LP tokens (BaseLpt) to the pool. Instead, it assumes that the `msg.sender` has correctly implemented the INapierMintCallback interface and will handle the token transfers within the mintCallback function.

## Vulnerability Detail
User A intends to add liquidity to the NapierPool contract. They send the underlying asset and BasePool LP tokens to the pool contract and then call addLiquidity with a low gas price, causing the transaction to remain pending.

An attacker observes User A's pending transaction and decides to front-run it. The attacker is an authorized callback receiver (perhaps due to a flaw in the authorization process or because they control a malicious contract that was authorized).

### Proof Of Concept
```javascript
// Assume User A has already sent tokens to the pool contract and initiates the following call:
napierPool.addLiquidity(underlyingAmount, baseLptAmount, userAAddress, data);

// Attacker observes the pending transaction and calls the same function with a higher gas price:
napierPool.addLiquidity(underlyingAmount, baseLptAmount, attackerAddress, data);
```

```javascript

// NapierPool contract snippet
function addLiquidity(uint256 underlyingInDesired, uint256 baseLptInDesired, address recipient, bytes memory data)
    external
    nonReentrant
    notExpired
    returns (uint256)
{
    // ... (omitted code for brevity)

    // Interaction with the callback receiver
    if (!factory.isCallbackReceiverAuthorized(msg.sender)) revert Errors.PoolUnauthorizedCallback();
    INapierMintCallback(msg.sender).mintCallback(underlyingUsed, baseLptUsed, data);

    // Check if the pool's balance has increased by the desired amounts
    if (_balance(tricrypto) < bBalance + baseLptUsed) revert Errors.PoolInsufficientBaseLptReceived();
    if (_balance(underlying) < uBalance + underlyingUsed) {
        revert Errors.PoolInsufficientUnderlyingReceived();
    }

```
In this scenario, if the attacker's transaction is confirmed before User A's transaction, the attacker will receive the LP tokens that were supposed to be minted for User A. This is because the addLiquidity function checks the pool's balance and not the specific contributions of msg.sender.


## Impact

The severity is considered high because the vulnerability can lead to financial loss for users and can be exploited by any attacker who is an authorized callback receiver. The integrity of the liquidity provision process is compromised, which is critical for a DeFi protocol.

## Code Snippet
 [`addLiquidity`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/NapierPool.sol#L158-L190)
```javascript
 /// @inheritdoc INapierPool
    /// @notice Provide BasePoolLpToken (BaseLpt) and underlying in exchange for Lp token, which will grant LP holders more exchange fee over time
    /// @dev Mint as much LP token as possible.
    /// @dev BaseLpt and Underlying should be transferred to this contract prior to calling
    /// @dev Revert if maturity is reached
    /// @dev Revert if deposited assets are too small to mint more than minimum liquidity
    /// @dev Revert if deposited assets are too small to compute ln implied rate
    /// @dev Revert if computed initial exchange rate in base LP token is below one. (deposited base LP token is much less than deposited underlying)
    /// @dev Revert if proportion of deposited base LP token is higher than the maximum proportion. (deposited base LP token is too large compared to deposited underlying)
    /// @dev Revert if minted LP token is zero
    /// @param recipient recipient of the minted LP token
    /// @return liquidity amount of LP token minted
    function addLiquidity(uint256 underlyingInDesired, uint256 baseLptInDesired, address recipient, bytes memory data)
        external
        override
        nonReentrant
        notExpired
        returns (uint256)
    {
        // Cache state variables
        (uint256 _totalUnderlying, uint256 _totalBaseLpt) = (totalUnderlying, totalBaseLpt);

        uint256 bBalance = _balance(tricrypto); // Base Pool LP token reserve
        uint256 uBalance = _balance(underlying); // NOTE: Sum of underlying asset reserve and stuck protocol fees.

        (uint256 liquidity, uint256 underlyingUsed, uint256 baseLptUsed) =
            _mintLiquidity(_totalUnderlying, _totalBaseLpt, recipient, underlyingInDesired, baseLptInDesired);

        /// WRITE ///
        // Last ln implied rate doesn't change because liquidity is added proportionally
        totalUnderlying = (_totalUnderlying + underlyingUsed).toUint128();
        totalBaseLpt = (_totalBaseLpt + baseLptUsed).toUint128();

        /// INTERACTION ///
        if (!factory.isCallbackReceiverAuthorized(msg.sender)) revert Errors.PoolUnauthorizedCallback();
        INapierMintCallback(msg.sender).mintCallback(underlyingUsed, baseLptUsed, data);

        /// CHECK ///
        if (_balance(tricrypto) < bBalance + baseLptUsed) revert Errors.PoolInsufficientBaseLptReceived();
        if (_balance(underlying) < uBalance + underlyingUsed) {
            revert Errors.PoolInsufficientUnderlyingReceived();
        }

        return liquidity;
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.  Implementing a deposit function that records the amounts of tokens each user has transferred to the pool, and only allowing users to add liquidity with their own tokens.
2.  Using the transferFrom function within addLiquidity to pull the tokens directly from the msg.sender, after verifying that the pool contract has been approved to spend the tokens.
