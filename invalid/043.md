# Insufficient Slippage Protection in Stake Function

## Summary
The `_stake` function lacks comprehensive slippage protection mechanisms, only checking for a received amount of `0` to prevent complete transaction failure. This does not safeguard against scenarios where the amount received is significantly less than expected due to slippage or unexpected fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function withdraws Wrapped Ether (WETH), submits it to `FRXETH_MINTER` contract, and then deposits it into a staking contract. It checks if the `received` amount is `0` to revert the transaction. However, this check does not account for slippage or minor but significant discrepancies between the expected and actual received amounts, potentially leading to financial losses for users.

## Impact
Users could experience financial loss if the actual amount received from the staking operation is significantly less than expected but not exactly `0`. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _stake(uint256 stakeAmount) internal override returns (uint256) {
    IWETH9(Constants.WETH).withdraw(stakeAmount);
    FRXETH_MINTER.submit{value: stakeAmount}();
    uint256 received = STAKED_FRXETH.deposit(stakeAmount, address(this));
    if (received == 0) revert InvariantViolation();

    return stakeAmount;
}
```

## Recommendation
- Adding a parameter for users to set their own slippage tolerance.
