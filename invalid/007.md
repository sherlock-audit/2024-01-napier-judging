# Denial of Service through Uncontrolled RefundETH Function

## Summary
The contract is exposed to a significant vulnerability, allowing any user to call the refundETH function and drain the contract's ETH balance. This vulnerability can be exploited for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, disrupting critical functions that rely on available ETH. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to implement access control mechanisms, limiting access to authorized users such as the contract owner. Additionally, considering frequency limitations or other safeguards in the refundETH function is advisable to prevent excessive drains. Thorough testing, code auditing, and clear communication with the community are essential steps to address and prevent potential exploits, ensuring the security and functionality of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker calls the refundETH function multiple times, draining the contract's ETH balance.
The contract's balance becomes depleted, impacting the ability to execute critical functions such as unwrapWETH9.
Users attempting to use the unwrapWETH9 function face failure due to insufficient ETH balance, leading to a denial of service.

## Impact
The contract is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the uncontrolled access to the refundETH function, which allows any user to trigger a refund of the contract's ETH balance. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to intentionally drain the contract's balance and, consequently, cause a denial of service to functions dependent on available ETH, such as the unwrapWETH9 function.


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/base/PeripheryPayments.sol#L68
    function refundETH() external payable {
        if (address(this).balance > 0) _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
    }

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/base/PeripheryPayments.sol#L32
    function unwrapWETH9(uint256 amountMinimum, address recipient) external payable {
        ..
            _safeTransferETH(recipient, balanceWETH9);
        }
    }

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/base/PeripheryPayments.sol#L73
   function _safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value) internal {
        (bool success,) = to.call{value: value}(new bytes(0));
        if (!success) revert Errors.FailedToSendEther();
    }

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the refundETH function to include an access control mechanism, such as the onlyOwner modifier, ensuring that only authorized users (e.g., the contract owner) can trigger the refund.
