# Users are unable to collect their yield if tranche is paused

## Summary

Users are unable to collect their yield if Tranche is paused, resulting in a loss of assets for the victims.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the contest's README page, it stated that the admin/owner is "RESTRICTED". Thus, any finding showing that the owner/admin can steal a user's funds, cause loss of funds or harm to the users, or cause the user's fund to be struck is valid in this audit contest.

> Q: Is the admin/owner of the protocol/contracts TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
>
> RESTRICTED

The admin of the protocol has the ability to pause the Tranche contract, and no one except for the admin can unpause it. If a malicious admin paused the Tranche contract, the users will not be able to collect their yield earned, leading to a loss of assets for them.

```solidity
File: Tranche.sol
603:     /// @notice Pause issue, collect and updateUnclaimedYield
604:     /// @dev only callable by management
605:     function pause() external onlyManagement {
606:         _pause();
607:     }
608: 
609:     /// @notice Unpause issue, collect and updateUnclaimedYield
610:     /// @dev only callable by management
611:     function unpause() external onlyManagement {
612:         _unpause();
613:     }
```

The following shows that the `collect` function can only be executed when the system is not paused.

```solidity
File: Tranche.sol
399:     function collect() public nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
400:         uint256 _lscale = lscales[msg.sender];
401:         uint256 accruedInTarget = unclaimedYields[msg.sender];
```

## Impact

Users are unable to collect their yield if Tranche is paused, resulting in a loss of assets for the victims.
