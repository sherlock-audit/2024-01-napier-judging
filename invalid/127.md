# No withdraw delay or cooldown period,

## Summary
        The contract does not implement a withdrawal delay or cooldown period, which could be a design choice but might also expose the system to liquidity risks if many users decide to withdraw simultaneously.

## Vulnerability Detail
 function requestWithdrawal() external virtual nonReentrant onlyRebalancer {
        if (requestId != 0) revert WithdrawalPending();

        uint256 targetBufferEth = (totalAssets() * targetBufferPercentage) / BUFFER_PERCENTAGE_PRECISION;

        // If the buffer exceeds the target buffer, revert.
        // If the buffer is insufficient, request a withdrawal to refill the buffer.
        // note: use `>=` instead of `>` to prevent amount of ETH to withdraw to be 0
        // note: At this point, `withdrawalQueueEth` is 0 because there is no pending withdrawal request.
        // `nonStakedEth` = `bufferEth` + 0 = `bufferEth`
        uint256 bufferEthCache = bufferEth;
        if (bufferEthCache >= targetBufferEth) revert BufferTooLarge();

        unchecked {
            // Ensure that `withdrawAmount` is non-zero and withdrawalQueueEth is zero.
            uint256 withdrawAmount = targetBufferEth - bufferEthCache; // no underflow

            /// WRITE & INTERACT ///
            // Record the pending withdrawal request
            // Request a withdrawal
  @>          (uint256 queueAmount, uint256 _requestId) = _requestWithdrawal(withdrawAmount);
            withdrawalQueueEth = queueAmount.toUint128();
            requestId = _requestId;
        }
    }
