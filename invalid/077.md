# Attacker can approve any transfers from NapierRouter to arbitrary addresses

## Summary

By crafting malicious `pool` contract attacker can bypass `pool` address check and approve any transfer of any ERC20 from NapierRouter to arbitrary addresses. 

## Vulnerability Detail

This issue is located in serveral methods in NapierPool contract. Let's examine the [`addLiquidity` method](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/main/v1-pool/src/NapierRouter.sol#L461-L511). 

```solidity
    function addLiquidity(
        address pool,
        uint256 underlyingIn,
        uint256[3] calldata ptsIn,
        uint256 liquidityMin,
        address recipient,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external payable override nonReentrant checkDeadline(deadline) returns (uint256) {
        (address underlying, address basePool) = INapierPool(pool).getAssets();
        if (INapierPool(pool) != PoolAddress.computeAddress(basePool, underlying, POOL_CREATION_HASH, address(factory)))
        {
            revert Errors.RouterPoolNotFound();
        }
...
        IERC20[3] memory pts = INapierPool(pool).principalTokens();

        if (pts[0].allowance(address(this), basePool) < ptsIn[0]) pts[0].approve(basePool, type(uint256).max); // dev: Principal token will revert if failed to approve
        if (pts[1].allowance(address(this), basePool) < ptsIn[1]) pts[1].approve(basePool, type(uint256).max);
        if (pts[2].allowance(address(this), basePool) < ptsIn[2]) pts[2].approve(basePool, type(uint256).max);
...
}
```
We can craft contract on `pool` address that will return malicious `underlying` and `basePool` parameters. We can also deploy crafted contract on specific address to pass check for `PoolAddress.computeAddress` â€” we know in advance all the parameters to `PoolAddress.computeAddress` call. 

After that the NapierRouter approves transfers of `pts[i]` to `basePool`, these parameters can be manipulated in crafted contract, thus allowing attacker to approve transfers of any ERC20 in `pts[i]` from `NapierRouter` to arbitrary address in `basePool`. 

## Impact

Possible stealing of funds from NapierRouter by attacker

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Improve check for `pool` address by storing verified `basePool` or `underlying` parameters in contract storage.
