# When `cScale` < `maxScale` Tranche Can Become Insolvent

## Summary

The protocol cannot pay out all withdrawers or redeemers when `cScale` < `maxScale`

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Tranche` calculates the asset to share conversion ratio based on the `maxScale` which is the highest value of the `scale` that has been recorded. However, if the current scale is lower than the maximum scale, then the total number of shares that could be redeemed would exceed the total shares in existence.


In `Tranche#redeemWithYt()`:

```solidity
[        if (_lscale != 0) {
            accruedInTarget += _computeAccruedInterestInTarget(_maxscale, _lscale, yBal);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-napier/blob/6313f34110b0d12677b389f0ecb3197038211e12/napier-v1/src/Tranche.sol#L261-L271)
        }


        // Transfer underlying from user to adapter and deposit it into adapter to get target token
        _underlying.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(adapter), underlyingAmount);
        (, uint256 sharesMinted) = adapter.prefundedDeposit();

        uint256 sharesUsed = sharesMinted + accruedInTarget;
        uint256 fee = sharesUsed.mulDivUp(issuanceFeeBps, MAX_BPS);
        issued = (sharesUsed - fee).mulWadDown(_maxscale);
```

This can happen for liquid staking derivatives, where the `scale` could have decreased from the past due to a slashing event. 

When this happens, if everybody withdraws, there wouldn't be enough assets to pay everybody out, and the protocol is insolvent.


## Impact

Protocol cannot payout all redeemers when they withdraw when `cScale < maxScale`

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `cScale` even when it is not the maximum it has ever been rather than the `maxScale`
