# decreasing scale lead to loss of PT token value and creates an arbitrage opportunity

## Summary
Users receive PT and YT tokens based on the underlying amount deposited, PT and underlying would have the same value most of the time (except after maturity ) but if the scale is decreased ( below max scale ) it creates a situation that users would receive more PT and YT tokens however this is not problematic since redeeming these tokens would still return deposited underlying but it creates an arbitrage opportunity to sell PT tokens to pool, actually users receive cheaper PT token in issuance than market price and this price difference comes from unminted yield because yield tokens wouldn't receive any yield until scale approaches max scale, decreasing scale happens when a withdrawal request is submitted on frax adapter because some fee is charged on withdraw the amount that leads to decreasing total assets and therefore scale, in this situation PT values as the underlying amount deposited.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider maxScale is 1.3 and current Scale is 1.3, now someone tries to issue some PT tokens he would receive 1000 PT and YT tokens ( we ignore fees for simplicity ) he sells yield tokens and expects to receive 1000 underlying by redeeming or selling principal ( since PT token represents principal amount ) but scale is decreased now maxScale is 1.3 and current scale is 1.2 no if he tries to redeem 1000 pt he would receive 923 underlying this happens because some part of minted shares has allocated to yield token before decreasing scale and since the scale is decreased principal has a lower value, and vise versa user that issue at this situation would receive more principal tokens ( valued as much as underlying) but this value change creates an opportunity to sell it to the pool and make a profit. 
## Impact
lose of principal token value
arbitrage opportunity
