# SFrxETHAdapter._stake() fails to check if `submit` is paused for frxETHMinter.

## Summary
submit could be paused in the  frxETHMinter at the time when SFrxETHAdapter._stake() is attempted and such scenarios isn't taken care of.
## Vulnerability Detail
here is a code snippet from frxETHMinter on ETherscan and it has a require statement to ensure a revert whenever  submitPaused == true. see [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbAFA44EFE7901E04E39Dad13167D089C559c1138#code#F1#L87)
```solidity
   /// @notice Mint frxETH to the recipient using sender's funds. Internal portion
    function _submit(address recipient) internal nonReentrant {
        // Initial pause and value checks
        require(!submitPaused, "Submit is paused");
        require(msg.value != 0, "Cannot submit 0");
```

The issue is that this is completedly neglected by SFrxETHAdapter._stake() as it doesn't check if the submitPaused is set to TRUE in the frxETHMinter, before attempting to submit in SFrxETHAdapter._stake().

```solidity
function _stake(uint256 stakeAmount) internal override returns (uint256) {
        IWETH9(Constants.WETH).withdraw(stakeAmount);
        FRXETH_MINTER.submit{value: stakeAmount}(); //@audit-issue   submit could be paused for frxETHMinter..
        uint256 received = STAKED_FRXETH.deposit(stakeAmount, address(this));
        if (received == 0) revert InvariantViolation();

        return stakeAmount;
    }
```

## Impact
whenever submitPaused is set to TRUE in the frxETHMinter, prefundedDeposit will likely always revert for SFrxETHAdapter. this will DOS tranche.issue() if adapter is SFrxETHAdapter

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
in SFrxETHAdapter._stake()  check the frxETHMinter if submitPaused is set to TRUE and look for a way to handle such scenarios in a way that it wouldn't affect SFrxETHAdapter's prefundedDeposit. So as to avoid DOS whenever it is called by Tranche.issue()
